IRhyme is an application, where people can design and print out custom cards for different occasions to give to their
friends, family, etc. They can customize the look of the card and make it occasion specific, but the main feature is
that they can also add a poem that is generated by an AI Poem Builder. This makes it both a unique opportunity and funny
one to interact with and allows them to create something truly special, a complete and mindful gift.

### We have done so far
We have implemented the skeleton for our project and project views. We call Pexels API for images with different query keywords. We have this keyword picture theme persisting across the different views. We have semi-functional text editor for editing the celebration card. 

### We still plan to do 
We need to fix fetching of the AI poems and displaying them, fix layout issues and make the website prettier and easier to use. 

### Project file structure (short description/purpose of each file)
We have views Welcome, SelectTheme, SelectCard, EditCard and PrintCard. Each one of them has a js file and a ccs file. In SelectTheme the user can choose some spesific theme for their card e.g. birthday. In the next view SelectCard the user can them pic a birthday related image for the final design of the card. In EditCard the custom text can be inputted and whole text look edited. In PrintCard the final card can be previewed and printed out. We have a file called PoetryModel which takes care of the back-end and API calls. App.js takes care of the overview of the webpage.
